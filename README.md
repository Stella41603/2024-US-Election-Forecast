# Predicting Percentage Support for Kamala Harris in the 2024 U.S. Election

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to predicting percentage support for Kamala Harris in the November 2024 U.S. election. Using polling data from publicly available sources, the project involves data collection, cleaning, model building, and analysis to forecast support trends. The repository includes simulated and real polling data, scripts for data processing, fitted models, and a detailed paper documenting the methodology and findings. By continuously updating as new polling data emerges, this project provides a flexible framework for tracking and predicting changes in public opinion leading up to the election.

-   `data/02-analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `models` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper.
